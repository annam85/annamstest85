We reach the fifth and final part of our human dimensions landscape : the Interactional Dimensions. Each dimension is introduced, related to existing scientific disciplines and portrayed by potential questions it may entail to properly assess and address the situation at hand.

Interacting with other humans, or at the very least other living forms, is one of our primal needs. We can only hold for so long without a relaxing conversation, a heated debate, a good moment with a friend or a productive meeting with a workmate. On one hand, these exchanges come to fulfil that aforementioned essential need of our nature, but on the other, they are a source of constant enrichment and evolution. A witty argument, a game of card, a jam session never unfolds the same way twice, each time bringing a new experience of which we are the creator and that teaches us in return. Interaction is fulfilment, interaction is creation, but what it fulfils and what it creates is more than meets the naked eye.

As you may have guessed by now, I am totally sold on this lifestyle. And last, but not the least - imagine what you can do with all that produce! All those apples! Here is an example.

## Linguistic

Linguistic refers to the individualâ€™s ability to understand, manipulate and express words. Words are the universal tools that the individual can use in everything they do, think and feel.  They shape their inner and outer dialogues. They can be manipulated and played with, for they can have more than one single meaning, and in that sense, one word can simultaneously reflect different facets of the individual. Similarly, words can be used by one individual to simultaneously touch upon different facets of another individual. There are words that the individual favours, for the beauty of their shape, the beauty of their sound, or the strength of the meaning they can carry. There are words that the individual avoids, as they may be deemed disturbing or uncomfortable. There are words that the individual mindlessly uses, popping up regularly in conversations or in train of thoughts.  These glorified, vilified, neglected words can tell a lot about the belonging of the individual. Beyond sharing a common basis, each cultural group has made theirs words which they feel are the most expressive of who they are. Spelling or grammar mistakes can become champions of renewed identities, just as more ancient terms and sentence forms can represent an attachment to centennial values and a certain upbringing. And those two sides can clash and combine, between groups, between individuals, or even within one individual. And in that sense, words, consistently, relentlessly, evolve. This perspective is best explored by Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology and Linguistics.
